To request data a user will write to sams microservice through the user interface. My microservice is constantly watching the database for a new song. When a song is added to the database then data is requested from my microservice.

To receive data from the microservice the user will have to ask for the playlist. On sams microservice the user will recieve the data through a terminal. The data from my microservice is recieved when sams microservice reads the database and writes the new songs that my database added to the user interface.
